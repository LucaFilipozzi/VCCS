This is the Very Complicated Credential Service.

The VCCS is en-route to becoming a complete authentication system with at
least a SAML IdP front end, a distributed user database, separate password
hashing servers etc.

Design started from performance requirements, so a nearly complete backend
service for password and OTP validation was the first thing to be
implemented.




Authentication
==============

Pseudo-code describing the authentication process :

  On frontend (SAML IdP, RADIUS server etc) :
  -------------------------------------------
  // Get rid of plaintext as soon as possible, to avoid leaking it (logs etc.)
  H1 = bcrypt(credential_id | plaintext_password, credential_stored_salt1)
  send_to_backend(H1, user_id, credential_id, credential_stored_hash)

  On backend (dedicated hashing servers) :
  ----------------------------------------
  T = 'A' | user_id | credential_id | H1  // Lock down key usage & credential
  salt = yhsm_hmac_sha1(T)                // to auth
  H2 = PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512(T, salt)

  audit_log(frontend_id, credential_id, H2, credential_stored_hash)

  return (H2 == credential_stored_hash)


Key management
==============

The HMAC keys used to derive the locally parameterized salt (in the dedicated
hashing servers) from the YubiHSMs should not be used indefinately.

If local password retention policy mandates users to change password every
three years, and key management policy limits key usage to credentials created
in a six months period, a total of seven six-months keys could be allowed to
co-exist simultaneously in the YubiHSM.

By having seven keys, the user can be authenticated for six months after the
password expires to allow for a password change. After 3.5 years, the password
would have to be reset using some external mechanism.

NIST SP 800-57 has recommendations regarding the lifetime of an "Symmetric
authentication key", saying that it should not be used on Originator systems
(operation: password set) for more than two years, and not on Recipient
systems (operation: passowrd validation) for more than two+three years.
