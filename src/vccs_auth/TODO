TODO for vccs_authbackend :

  * allow protected transport - TLS? or offload that using nginx front end?
    currently, an SSL offloader is part of the spec.

  * facilitate external HSM hashing service, to make HSM management more separated
    from the computational heavy PBKFF2 hashing?

  * somehow sign the response so that an audit log from another part of VCCS
    can prove if an authentication request was in fact sent to a backend or not

  * audit log to something else than syslog?

  * generate signatures of authentication events, using YubiHSM AEADs?

  * backends need a revocation API. Revocation support is already in credential
    store, but a way to invoke it is currently missing.
